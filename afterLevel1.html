                                   The door swings right open!!
                        Miguel is astonished that he still remembers coding 101s.
                         However the doors opened up to nothing but darkness.
                Suddenly the lights came on. Oddly it was an aisle of an old library,
                                 30 foot high bookshelves on each side.
         Miguel slowly walked down the aisle expecting something to pop up in front of him.
     Fortunately, nothing did. When he reached the end, he saw an ancient box computer on which
                                     there was a note that read
                                “SOLVE IT BEFORE EXAM PRESSURE GETS TO YA”
                 Suddenly the two shelves behind him started to creep towards each other.
               Miguel had to solve the problem and save himself from being crushed !!
