                                              The gate flung right open!
   Miguel couldn’t believe it! He limped into the opening and before he could know any better he collapses and loses consciousness	.
   When he opens his eyes again, he is lying in his cozy bed with his king Darius by his bedside with a book in his hand.
   “Welcome back son” says Darius and he hands Miguel the book.
   The cover says “To beloved Miguel from your long neglected brother, Roberto”. Miguel confused now more than ever flips open the book.
                               The first lines start “In a land not so far away….”.
